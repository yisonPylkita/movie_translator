1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,510
How much longer to the embassy?

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,150
I believe it'll be around twenty minutes, sir.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,510
Huh?

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,990
The brakes aren't working.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,430
Hey! In front of you! Watch out! Stop!

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,440
One of our diplomats lost their life 
in a car accident while visitng Ostania.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,450
We suspect this was an assassination 
by the East's Republican Party.

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,410
It's becoming clearer by day that they're 
 trying to force Westalis into an all-out war.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,120
We must uncover their plot, 
no matter the cost.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,420
Let's put <i>him</i> on the job.

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,420
With stakes this high, 
we need the best agent we got,

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,720
Twilight.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,270
Here are the goods, as promised.

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,020
This proves the foreign minister wears a toupee.

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,130
I even have the negatives.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,990
Well done.

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,470
This will help seal his resignation.

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,430
Pleasure doing business.

19
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,770
Hey.

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,050
How about you hand over those goods now?

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,670
Huh? Wha—But you were just—

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,320
I got duped!

23
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,700
Code name: Twilight.

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,380
Occupation: spy.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,130
In an era where the nations of the world 
fight a fierce information war in the shadows,

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,040
this man has survived by being a master of disguise, 
capable of donning hundreds of different faces.

27
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,960
Daddy's been in such a foul mood lately 
'cause someone stole pics of his toupee or something.

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,100
What even? Ugh, I'm so mad.

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,250
Are you even listening, Robert?

30
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,600
Hmm? Ah, yes. That's a shame.

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,540
So, Robert, do you think that'll be us one day?

32
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,280
Karen, let's break up.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,950
What?!

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,650
A rock would make for a more 
engaging conversational partner.

35
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,860
Best of luck in your future endeavours.

36
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,230
Hey, Robert! Hey! 
You can't just walk out on me!

37
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,620
Robert!

38
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,630
<i>Sorry, Karen, but I have 
no further use for you or your family.</i>

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,630
<i>As of tonight, I'm done 
donning the mask of Robert.</i>

40
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,870
<i>Marriage? Conventional happiness?</i>

41
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,850
<i>I buried those aspirations with my identity 
the day I became a spy.</i>

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,190
Meow.

43
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,820
<i>Must be Cipher C.</i><i></i>

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,530
The train bound for Berlint 
is now departing from track five.

45
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,610
<i>Good day. Or perhaps, good evening, </i><i>Twilight</i><i>.</i>

46
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,290
<i>Excellent work on your last assignment.</i>

47
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,690
<i>Thanks to you, the minister lives another day, 
to the great benefit of our country.</i>

48
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,050
<i>Now, without further ado, 
here is your next mission.</i>

49
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,150
<i>Your target is the head of 
the National Unity Party, Donovan Desmond.</i>

50
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,050
<i>He poses a grave threat to the truce 
between the East and the West.</i>

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,460
<i>Your mission is to get close to him 
and probe</i><i> for any seditious activities.</i>

52
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,660
<i>In order to achieve this goal, 
you are to get married and bear a child.</i><i></i>

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,880
Say what?

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,700
<i>Desmond is an extremely cautious man 
who rarely shows his face in public.</i>

55
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,980
<i>He only makes public appearances at social gatherings 
held at the elite private school his son attends.</i>

56
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,880
<i>They serve as informal get-togethers for 
the upper echelon of industrial and political leaders.</i>

57
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,310
<i>Your child will enrol in this school 
and infiltrate one of these gatherings.</i><i></i>

58
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,120
<i>The enrolment deadline is drawing near. 
You only have one week to pull this off.</i><i></i>

59
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,590
You expect me to produce a child 
within seven days?!

60
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,390
Excuse me.

61
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,140
<i>We call it Operation Strix.</i>

62
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,620
<i>It's the key to maintaining peace between 
the East and West—perhaps even the world at large.</i>

63
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,940
<i>Hero who casts no shadow,</i>

64
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,110
<i>the great deeds of you and your fellow agents 
shall never see the light of day.</i>

65
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,550
<i>You will never be awarded a medal, 
let alone receive public fanfare.</i>

66
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,610
<i>But don't forget,</i>

67
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,870
<i>the peaceful lives of our citizens 
are a product of your blood, sweat, and tears.</i>

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,460
<i>Fine.</i>

69
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,390
<i>I abandoned my identity 
the day I became </i><i>Twilight</i><i>.</i>

70
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,200
<i>I will play the role of a parent if I must,</i>

71
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,190
<i>for the sake of a safer world.</i>

72
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,870
MISSION:1

73
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,870
MISSION:1

74
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,870
MISSION:1

75
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,870
Operation Strix

76
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,870
Operation Strix

77
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,870
Operation Strix

78
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,840
This is one of our furnished single-family units.

79
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,500
It comes with central heating 
and air conditioning, as well as...

80
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,880
Excuse me, sir?

81
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,540
<i>No wiretaps to be found, 
and ample securable escape routes.</i>

82
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,810
I'll take it.

83
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,520
Excellent, Mr. Forger. 
Would you sign these documents?

84
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,310
<i>Loid Forger. Occupation: psychiatrist.</i>

85
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,610
<i>That's my new life.</i>

86
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,850
<i>With a family I cherish 
and a happy home life...</i>

87
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:43,480
It must be lovely to move into 
a new house with your family.

88
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:45,740
Do you have a boy or a girl?

89
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:47,360
Ah, well...

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,660
I'll be deciding that soon.

91
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,520
Huh?

92
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,340
<i>What an absolute burden for a spy.</i>

93
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,530
Yeah? You wanna adopt a kid, do ya?

94
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,510
Indeed. I was told your orphanage 
was looking for couples wanting to adopt.

95
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,390
You see, my wife and I—

96
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,780
Yeah, sure. Just grab whichever you want.

97
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,390
Come on in.

98
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,740
<i>What a horrible environment.</i>

99
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,270
<i>But an establishment this shady 
is likely to have incomplete records.</i>

100
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,420
<i>It will be easier to come up with a backstory.</i>

101
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,150
<i>I can pull this mission off if I have a child.</i>

102
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,470
<i>I would've preferred to handle it on my own,</i>

103
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,210
<i>but I can't exactly disguise myself as a child,</i><i></i>

104
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,410
<i>no matter how skilled a spy I may be.</i>

105
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,440
I should mention, I'd like a child 
who is already literate if possible.

106
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,910
Yeah? In that case...

107
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,560
Anya, get over here.

108
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,330
She's the sharpest tool in our shed.

109
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,420
She don't talk much, but she's a good kid.

110
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,830
<i>Creepy little brat weirds me out.</i>

111
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,280
<i>I'd be thrilled to get her outta my hair.</i><i></i>

112
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,180
Come on, Anya. Say hi.

113
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,310
Er... Hello there.

114
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,310
<i>If I recall, the earliest age students 
can enter Eden College is six.</i>

115
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,130
<i>She looks no older than four or five at best.</i>

116
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:55,820
Six.

117
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,530
I'm six!

118
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:59,820
You're six, were ya?

119
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,280
<i>She's quite short for that age.</i>

120
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,820
<i>Hm? The paper?</i>

121
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,700
<i>A crossword puzzle?</i>

122
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,110
<i>That's probably too difficult for a child.</i>

123
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,800
<i>Of course, for an adult 
such as myself, it's mere child's play.</i>

124
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,720
<i>One down is "homeostasis".</i>

125
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,750
<i>One across is "causal closure".</i><i></i><i></i>

126
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,260
<i>The one below that is "symplectomorphism".</i>

127
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,550
<i>She completed it? Seriously?</i>

128
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,500
<i>What a stunning display of intellect!</i>

129
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,270
<i>She should have no problem 
acing the entrance exam!</i>

130
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,560
I'll take her.

131
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,310
About the paperwork...

132
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,360
Ah, who cares. Get her outta here already.

133
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,000
<i>Child acquired.</i>

134
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,180
<i>Everything's going so well, 
I'm feeling jumpy.</i>

135
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,650
Is this okay with you?

136
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,260
<i>A spy on a mission...</i>

137
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,570
<i>So cool!</i>

138
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,810
This girl happened to be a telepath.

139
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:53,140
Test Subject 007.

140
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,190
She possesses the ability to read minds.

141
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,580
She was the byproduct of an experiment conducted by 
an unknown organization, who had later fled their facility.

142
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,320
She relocated many times, 
searching for someone to care for her.

143
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,740
Listen, young lady.

144
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,540
Anya.

145
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,990
Listen, Anya.

146
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:10,050
Starting today, you will be my daughter.

147
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,040
But if anyone asks, you've <i>always</i> 
been my daughter. Am I clear?

148
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,680
Yup.

149
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,180
Make sure you address me as "Father".

150
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,260
Daddy!

151
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:20,190
Close enough.

152
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,780
Well, aren't you a little cutie pie? Hello there.

153
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,600
We're the Forgers. We just moved in today.

154
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm Anya. I've always been my daddy's daughter.

155
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,680
<i>Don't say unnecessary things.</i>

156
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,700
Come on, let's go see inside.

157
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,920
This is my house now?

158
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,700
Yes.

159
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,960
A telly!

160
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,020
Go ahead and turn it on.

161
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:43,400
The adventure cartoon, Spy Wars!

162
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,770
This is my favourite!

163
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,720
<i>Of all shows...</i>

164
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,100
You have a silenced pistol?

165
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,090
So cool.

166
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,060
You must be a pro!

167
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,220
<i>First, I'll have to secure all the necessary items.</i>

168
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,630
I'll be taking back that bomb.

169
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,600
<i>I'll also have to forge an ID for her.</i>

170
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,700
Anyone who gets in my way will regret it.

171
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,180
I'm stepping out for a bit.

172
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,820
Be a good girl and watch your show.

173
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,850
Outta my way!

174
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,780
An adventure!

175
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,860
It's not an adventure, 
it's a shopping trip!

176
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,830
I wanna no-pew-pew pistol!

177
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,370
If we see one on sale, okay?

178
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,070
<i>A master spy must never draw unwanted attention.</i>

179
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,910
<i>Today we're a regular, inconspicuous family.</i>

180
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,080
Daddy!

181
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,000
Save meee!

182
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,380
Must<i> you draw attention?</i>

183
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,720
Now, now. You need to make sure 
you hold the little one's hand.

184
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,630
Okay?

185
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,440
<i>Having one hand tied up makes it difficult 
to prepare for an ambush, but I can manage.</i>

186
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,530
<i>There's bad guys?!</i>

187
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:44,190
What are you doing?

188
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,030
Hiding!

189
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,400
<i>Did I do something to make her 
want to hide from me?</i>

190
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,020
<i>Perhaps I held her hand too early. 
Does she hate me?</i>

191
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,880
<i>That won't do.</i>

192
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,410
<i>I have to maintain a good relationship with her 
until the mission is complete.</i>

193
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,450
<i>I must understand how this creature thinks!</i>

194
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,410
<i>Understanding the other party 
is the first step toward peace.</i>

195
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,290
<i>Understanding me means world peace?!</i>

196
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,290
I like peanuts.

197
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,450
And I hate carrots.

198
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,460
Uh-huh...

199
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,340
But I really like bacon from bakenries!

200
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,560
A "bakery". I'm afraid they do not sell bacon.

201
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,350
I want this.

202
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,730
That costs a dalc. 
A ten-pent coin won't be enough.

203
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,260
<i>This girl doesn't appear all that bright.</i>

204
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,030
<i>Was the crossword puzzle a fluke?</i>

205
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,900
<i>Maybe I can still trade her in for another child—</i>

206
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,200
Pwease don't get rid of me!

207
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,250
What's wrong with you?

208
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,020
What a horrible father.

209
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,600
Pwease! I'm a good deal!

210
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,940
<i>What do I do?</i>

211
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,250
I'll buy you peanuts if you stop crying!

212
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,130
Peanuts!
