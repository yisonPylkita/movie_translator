1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,510
How much longer to the embassy?

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,150
I believe it'll be around twenty minutes, sir.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,510
Huh?

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:12,990
The brakes aren't working.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,430
Hey! In front of you! Watch out! Stop!

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,440
One of our diplomats lost their life 
in a car accident while visitng Ostania.

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,450
We suspect this was an assassination 
by the East's Republican Party.

8
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,410
It's becoming clearer by day that they're 
 trying to force Westalis into an all-out war.

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,120
We must uncover their plot, 
no matter the cost.

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,420
Let's put <i>him</i> on the job.

11
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,420
With stakes this high, 
we need the best agent we got,

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,720
Twilight.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,270
Here are the goods, as promised.

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,020
This proves the foreign minister wears a toupee.

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,130
I even have the negatives.

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,990
Well done.

17
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,470
This will help seal his resignation.

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,430
Pleasure doing business.

19
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:02,770
Hey.

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,050
How about you hand over those goods now?

21
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,670
Huh? Wha—But you were just—

22
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,320
I got duped!

23
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:15,700
Code name: Twilight.

24
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,380
Occupation: spy.

25
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,130
In an era where the nations of the world 
fight a fierce information war in the shadows,

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:31,040
this man has survived by being a master of disguise, 
capable of donning hundreds of different faces.

27
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,960
Daddy's been in such a foul mood lately 
'cause someone stole pics of his toupee or something.

28
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,100
What even? Ugh, I'm so mad.

29
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,250
Are you even listening, Robert?

30
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,600
Hmm? Ah, yes. That's a shame.

31
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,540
So, Robert, do you think that'll be us one day?

32
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,280
Karen, let's break up.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,950
What?!

34
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,650
A rock would make for a more 
engaging conversational partner.

35
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,860
Best of luck in your future endeavours.

36
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:01,230
Hey, Robert! Hey! 
You can't just walk out on me!

37
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,620
Robert!

38
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:06,630
<i>Sorry, Karen, but I have 
no further use for you or your family.</i>

39
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,630
<i>As of tonight, I'm done 
donning the mask of Robert.</i>

40
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,870
<i>Marriage? Conventional happiness?</i>

41
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,850
<i>I buried those aspirations with my identity 
the day I became a spy.</i>

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,190
Meow.

43
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,820
<i>Must be Cipher C.</i><i></i>

44
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,530
The train bound for Berlint 
is now departing from track five.

45
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,610
<i>Good day. Or perhaps, good evening, </i><i>Twilight</i><i>.</i>

46
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,290
<i>Excellent work on your last assignment.</i>

47
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,690
<i>Thanks to you, the minister lives another day, 
to the great benefit of our country.</i>

48
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:52,050
<i>Now, without further ado, 
here is your next mission.</i>

49
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:56,150
<i>Your target is the head of 
the National Unity Party, Donovan Desmond.</i>

50
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,050
<i>He poses a grave threat to the truce 
between the East and the West.</i>

51
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:03,460
<i>Your mission is to get close to him 
and probe</i><i> for any seditious activities.</i>

52
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,660
<i>In order to achieve this goal, 
you are to get married and bear a child.</i><i></i>

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,880
Say what?

54
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,700
<i>Desmond is an extremely cautious man 
who rarely shows his face in public.</i>

55
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,980
<i>He only makes public appearances at social gatherings 
held at the elite private school his son attends.</i>

56
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,880
<i>They serve as informal get-togethers for 
the upper echelon of industrial and political leaders.</i>

57
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:28,310
<i>Your child will enrol in this school 
and infiltrate one of these gatherings.</i><i></i>

58
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,120
<i>The enrolment deadline is drawing near. 
You only have one week to pull this off.</i><i></i>

59
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,590
You expect me to produce a child 
within seven days?!

60
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,390
Excuse me.

61
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,140
<i>We call it Operation Strix.</i>

62
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,620
<i>It's the key to maintaining peace between 
the East and West—perhaps even the world at large.</i>

63
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,940
<i>Hero who casts no shadow,</i>

64
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:52,110
<i>the great deeds of you and your fellow agents 
shall never see the light of day.</i>

65
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,550
<i>You will never be awarded a medal, 
let alone receive public fanfare.</i>

66
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,610
<i>But don't forget,</i>

67
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,870
<i>the peaceful lives of our citizens 
are a product of your blood, sweat, and tears.</i>

68
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,460
<i>Fine.</i>
